In JSX for is written as htmlFor. And class is written as className.
We can return only a single tag inside app.js file and so if want to return more than one tag make use of JSX fragment- <> and </> in the
start and end.
anything written inside {} is js in JSX. It is resolved that way, we dont need to put any '' inside the {} for that.
Always terminate the tagging in JSX. 
Babel compiles JSX to react calls.
In Single page application HTLM, CSS and JS gets downloaded once and further calls in it can be done using API. Whereas a multi page application downloads
HTML CSS and JS everytime new route is hit. And thus require more bandwidth.
npm i or npm install will create node modules folder again, so while sharing the folder we can delete node modules folder as it can be reinstalled.
'props' are properties in which we can pass the required info which we want to display.
'state' belongs to a component.
In function based component hooks are used to set state.
with the help of 'React Routers' we can change the components without reloading the whole page.
